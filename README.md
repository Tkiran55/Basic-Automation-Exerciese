#Automation Exercise Project
This project is an automated test suite built using Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Java to perform end-to-end testing on the Automation Exercise website. The goal is to automate common actions such as user registration, login, adding products to the cart, checking out, and making a payment.

#Features:
-- Browser Setup: Automatically opens the Chrome browser and navigates to the Automation Exercise website.
-- User Registration: Automates the process of signing up a new user with valid credentials.
-- User Login: Logs in to the website using valid credentials.
-- Add to Cart: Adds products to the cart, views the cart, and removes products from the cart.
-- Checkout and Payment: Completes the checkout process by entering shipping and payment details, and verifies successful order placement.
-- TestNG Integration: The tests are structured using TestNG, allowing for easy execution, parallel test runs, and reporting.

#Technologies Used:
-- Selenium WebDriver: For browser automation and interacting with web elements.
-- TestNG: For test management, assertions, and reporting.
-- Java: The programming language used to write the test scripts.
-- WebDriverManager: Manages browser driver binaries automatically.
-- Maven: Used to manage project dependencies and build the project.

#Test Scenarios:
-- Login and Registration: Validates the login and registration processes using pre-defined credentials.
-- Cart Functionality: Validates the addition of products to the cart, viewing the cart, and removing products.
-- Checkout and Payment: Validates the checkout process, including the payment procedure with mock payment details.
